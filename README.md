# PI-Temperature
A test to create a simple Python application which sends and receives Raspberry Pi temperature using MQTT

I have created this simple piece of code which contains a publisher and one monitor side. The publisher is meant to run on a Raspberry Pi while the monitor side can be executed in any platform provided with a Python3 interpreter (including that same Raspberry Pi). 

This application is using Mosquitto as the MQTT broker.
